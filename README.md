kp- Currently on the main-menu, click on top of a world and an alert appears. I spent some time trying to figure out how to replace the alert with the opening of a scene from the world-scene array in the world-scene.js file.
using ajax and 'GET' requests, I got a url to open but it displays a 404 error. I am going to abandon this approach and read through the phaser3 documentation.
